What do I need for this project to run
Note this file is different from requirements.txt as that is used for the workflow
Pip installed? (Easy)
    Add pip into your env (Med)

    Libaries?
        Flask installed (Easy)

compiler used - windows



points of confusion I had:
why does not flask work when I have it installeed already?
Why do I need to make a sepearte env for a directory. ex: I made a virtual env on test-gitlab
    why does the cmd python3 -m pip install flask work while py -3 -m pip install flask is meant for windows?
    .\venv\Scripts\activate to start this
    $picking the windows interpreter helped (ctr + shift + p), but only shoes linux ones with bin folder
    I need one with Script folder so I went with windows
